# Weather and Energy Consumption Forecasting

This project aims to provide insights into how weather patterns, particularly temperature and seasonal variations, influence energy consumption across different states in the U.S. Using historical weather data (temperature, Cooling Degree Days (CDD), and Heating Degree Days (HDD)), along with energy consumption data for different sectors (Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Transport), this app helps users understand the correlations between weather patterns and energy consumption.

## Features:
- **Temperature Forecasting**: Predicts the average temperature for the next 60 months using historical weather data.
- **Weather-Energy Clustering**: Analyzes correlations between weather patterns and energy consumption across U.S. states.
- **Seasonal Energy Relationships**: Helps users understand how seasonal temperature variations impact energy consumption for different sectors.
- **Feedback System**: Allows users to submit feedback directly within the app.
